I started my career in Supply chain analytics domain after Mtech in Industrial Engineering and Mgmt in Indian service based MNC.

After I completed 3.3 years, I knew I had to move to product based company for better salary, perks, free food, bonuses and learning. And once you stay longer in service based, moving to product is difficult as life becomes stagnant and appetite for learning curves become downward.

My previous company boss tried to provide counter offer and salary matching, I told I won't accept it and I requested for notice period.

My interview in Current company was of 5 rounds. It was the great decision to join a US based product based company and I joined with 80 percentage hike from previous company.

I work for 12 hours in lockdown but I enjoy my work.
